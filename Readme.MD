SfInv Home GUI

This mod adds a HOME tab to your sfinv inventory and allows the player to set a
home point using the buttons provided, return to the home point or go to spawn.

Note: This only supplements the /home /sethome and /spawn commands and players
require the 'home' privelage for everything to work.
